# StrategicAgent Negotiation Strategy

## 1. Opening
- Start with a **friendly and cooperative tone**.
- Make an **initial offer slightly better** than desired outcome (leaves room for concessions).

## 2. Mid Negotiation
- Use **anchoring** to set expectations.
- Apply **reciprocity**: every concession expects one in return.
- Ask open-ended questions to understand the opponentâ€™s priorities.

## 3. Concessions
- Concede gradually (avoid big jumps).
- Save one **"easy-to-give" concession** for later to build goodwill.

## 4. Closing
- If close to an agreement: push for **mutual gains**.
- If terms are unfair: politely **walk away** rather than accept.

## 5. Personality Influence
- **Assertive**: stands firm on key points.
- **Agreeable**: keeps discussion polite and constructive.
- **Patient**: waits for the opponent to reveal weaknesses.
- **Fallback**: withdraw if opponent exploits cooperation.
